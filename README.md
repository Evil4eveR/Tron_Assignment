##Task Description (No 4. Tron):

Create a game, with we can play the light-motorcycle battle (known from the Tron movie) in a top 
view. Two players play against each other with two motors, where each motor leaves a light trace 
behind of itself on the display. The motor goes in each seconds toward the direction, that the player 
has set recently. The first player can use the WASD keyboard buttons, while the second one can use 
the cursor buttons for steering. A player loses if its motor goes to the boundary of the game level, or 
it goes to the light trace of the other player. Ask the name of the players before the game starts, and 
let them choose the color their light traces. Increase the counter of the winner by one in the database 
at the end of the game. If the player does not exit in the database yet, then insert a record for him.

a menu item which restarts the game.
